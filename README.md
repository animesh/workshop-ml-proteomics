# Workshop: Tackling identification ambiguity in immunopeptidomics and in open modification searches with machine learning

[![Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/compomics/workshop-ml-proteomics/HEAD)

In this workshop, you will learn how to predict LC-MS behavior of peptides and how these predictions can be leveraged to identify (modified) peptides. First, you will learn how to use the machine learning tools MS²PIP and DeepLC to accurately predict peptide fragmentation spectra and chromatography retention time. Tips, tricks, and some specific caveats will be shown. Then, you will see how these tools can be integrated into the identification process through rescoring with MS²Rescore. You will apply MS²Rescore to an immunopeptidomics dataset, where traditional identification workflows often fall short. Next, we will look into the open-modification search results of the fully data-driven search engine ionbot and see how predicted information can help to drastically reduce ambiguity between peptidoforms. Open questions and challenges to the field will be discussed.

Throughout the workshop, we will use interactive Jupyter notebooks. While no coding skills are required, participants with programming experience will be able to take a look behind the veil of the tutorial-style notebooks and see how our tools can be integrated in custom bioinformatics workflows.
